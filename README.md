# Advanced Particle Detectors and Data Analysis: Exercises
These are notes and exercises for the course "Advanced Particle Detectors and Data Analysis". Professor doc. dr. Rok Dolenec 
has compiled the exercises and notes for the course but I find the provided solutions to be lacking in detail.

The course is part of the Master's program in Physics at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia.

I'd like to apologize in advance for the poor quality of my notebook scan. My main phone camera is damaged and I was forced to 
use the wide-angle camera which has a lower resolution and introduces a lot of distortion. I hope it's still readable.

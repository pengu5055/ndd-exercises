# Advanced Particle Detectors and Data Analysis: Exercises
These are notes and exercises for the course "Advanced Particle Detectors and Data Analysis". Professor doc. dr. Rok Dolenec 
has compiled the exercises and notes for the course but I find the provided solutions to be lacking in detail.

The course is part of the Master's program in Physics at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia.
